This is my first Git, please be kind.
I have modified Steve Edwards collision avoidance carbot.
I now use the L298n library
I now use the NewPing library
I have been slowly but surely adding functionality to make it more fun to watch. 
I used an Arduino UNO, a L298n motor control board, a g90 servo, and a US-04 ultrasonic sensor.
The battery connects to the L298 motor board and should be >7.0Vdc. The regulated 5Vdc from the motor board goes to the Vin on the UNO, the servo and the US-04. (see jumper block)
